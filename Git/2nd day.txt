Today we learnt about git branching 
git branch name
git checkout branch 
My git is  still master not main 
You know the changes are no longer seen if i chnage the branch even in my local repo. 

Now we learnt merging :
git merge development 
git merge main 

Git Conflicts :
Conflicts arise when same content edited in same file in different branches and merge attempted. 
They need to be solved manually.
